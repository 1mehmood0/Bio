Hey, this is Syed Mohammad Mehmood!

I am currently a final-year student of BTech (CSE) from Dehradun Institute of Technology, Dehradun.

My hometown is Lucknow, which is famous for its adab/courtesy and kebabs.

I like to work on backend technologies, primarily Node/Express/Mongo/SQL.

I also love watching anime. My first anime was Death Note, and my personal favorite is Naruto.

Apart from that, I love driving cars. Most of my free time is spent driving or working on my Jeep (M&M 1969), which sometimes breaks down in the middle of nowhere. But even the shortest drive gives me a thrill that is unmatched.

Wanna see? Iâ€™ll show it.
